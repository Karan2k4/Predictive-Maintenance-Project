# Predictive Maintenance for Textile Machinery

A mini-project simulating predictive maintenance for textile machinery using synthetic IoT sensor data.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

In textile manufacturing, unplanned machine failures lead to costly downtimes. This project demonstrates how machine learning can help predict potential failures in advance using sensor data.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- 1000 synthetic data points
- Features:
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Vibration (mm/s)
  - Pressure (Bar)
  - Failure (0 = No Failure, 1 = Failure)
  
---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Steps

1. Synthetic data generation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation heatmaps & pairplots
4. Model building (Random Forest Classifier)
5. Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
6. Feature importance visualization

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Temperature and Vibration are strong predictors of failure.
- Model achieved high classification accuracy.
- Project demonstrates potential for real-time predictive maintenance systems.

---

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

- Deploy with real IoT sensor data.
- Extend to real-time streaming pipelines.
- Integrate with dashboards for live monitoring.
